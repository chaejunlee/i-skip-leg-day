## User Flow

1. User opens the app, signs in, and goes to the main page.
   1. The main page shows the list of date and the split for each day.
   2. It would be cool to show the total volume for each day.
   3. On the main page let's show a graph of the total volume for the last month.
      1. red for the push, black for the pull, no legs.
2. User creates a Day and sets today's split.
   1. Today by default.
   2. It would be cool it is done within a dialog.
      1. Or page with a form, whatever.
      2. The thing is, we should not allow the use to create same day twice.
   3. It would be cool to show previous workout's split
3. User adds exercises to the Day
   1. I want to implement some kind of graph to show the progress.
   2. Let's do this with a dialog.
   3. When adding an exercise
      1. let's show the previous workout's weight.
